</h2>
<p>Landhorn was founded by a team of landmen, GIS specialists, and software engineers who have spent over a decade inside the title industry. We've seen firsthand how much time is lost to manual data entry, slow document searches, and disconnected tools.</p>
<p>Our mission is to modernize the land workflow — one process at a time. We build modular, cloud-based tools that help brokers, attorneys, and analysts move faster while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p class="mb-0">We believe the future of land services is connected. Landhorn's platform acts as infrastructure — not just another app — linking data, people, and processes together.</p>
